## Structure

Each directory is organized by year.
  
For each year, you will find:
- **Days completed**, in the `<year>_day<nb>` or `<year>_day<nb>part<nb>` form, with the extension depending on the programming language used.
- **`datas/` folder:** All data from each days. There are:
  - Examples I used to test my code : `<year>_day<nb>_exemple` and optionally the example number
  - Data files to complete the day : `<year>_day_<nb>_data`
